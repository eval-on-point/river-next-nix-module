      A tiling window manager DWM-style tiling window manager with built-in wallpaper and a clock/bar written in Zig. The window manager communicates using the river-window-management-v1 protocol, as well as some of River's additional Wayland protocols.
      Beansprout uses a primary/stack tiling layout inspired by dwm with a customizable ratio and primary count.
      Similarly, beansprout has a 32-bit tag system, rather than workspaces. Each output has its own tags and own primary count/ratio.
